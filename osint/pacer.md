## Tips and Tricks

Accounts are billed on a quarterly basis. If you account has a balance of less than $30, PACER will  waive the bill.

### Locating case records

To locate a case you need a couple pieces of information:

- The case number
- The court trying the case

Case numbers formats looks something like this `2:00-cv-00084`.

Case information can be found on legal search engines like Law360. While these search engine often hide most of the information behind a paywall, they expose enough to start the process on PACER.
